            <p><b>Instructions:</b>You can choose to be either on your own or team up in pairs of two, where one teammate has to ride on the back of the other. A cord is placed at head height with all the rings hanging about one meter (three feet) apart attached to it. A starting line is placed about eight meters (24 feet) away from the cord. If not in teams the players have to run at constant speed, with their arm outstretched and their forefinger pointing towards the rings, trying to catch the rings. If in teams the one riding on the others back has to try to catch the ring with their arm outstretched, while the one carrying the other has to run towards the rings. The objective is to catch the ring as many times as possible in ten tries. </p>

            <p><b>Intstruktions:</b>The players have to stand in a circle. A person is chosen to start the game by touching one of the other players with a limb of their choosing e.g. leg, arm or nose. That limb is now stuck to the other person and the person who started has to keep their limb at the place they chose to touch the other player. That is called slurping, and when slurping someone you have to make a loud “sluuurp” noise. The turn is passed on the person who was just slurped, and that person has to slurp someone else. The game ends when someone breaks their slurp and remove one of their limbs from another person.</p>

Every time you steal a tail you put it into your waistband and in that way you have more tails that can be stolen. A timer is set to 5-10 minutes. The winner is whoever has the most tails when time is up.</p>

The players trying to avoid the bull is allowed to let go of the rope, but the rope must not touch the ground. The players holding the rope can run around with the rope too, giving the circle different shapes as the game progresses. If the bull manages to catch someone, they have to swap places, so that the person caught becomes the bull. If the rope touches the ground the bull chooses someone to swap places with.</p>

The last person to be tagged wins the game. Hint: The game can be played without the chains breaking up when reaching four people, and this way ending up creating one large chain.</p>

When the person the in the middle then yells “the fire has been put out”, all the joggers has to stand in front of a “mountain” person. The “jogger” who does not manage to find a “mountain” person to stand in front of swaps places with the “jogger” in the middle.

When a car is hit by the killer bumper car it stops working and has to stand still on the spot they were hit. The last bumper car to be hit by the killer bumper car has to be the killer bumper car in the next round. The drivers and the bumper cars swap roles every new round. Hint: For new players to learn the game make a test round. If necessary mark the killer bumper car somehow, so the drivers knows who is the killer bumper car.</p>

If the princess is caught by the dragon the roles swaps, and the former dragon is now the princess and the former princess is now the dragon. If the princess gets tired of fleeing from the dragon she can grab onto one the players who stands in a pair. The person in the pair who is not holding on to the princess is now the new dragon, and the former dragon becomes the princess. The game ends after a specific time, that the players agree upon before starting. It is important that the players who are either the dragon or the princess enter into the spirit of their role. The dragon has to use their arms as wings and roar, and the princess has to scream while running. Otherwise it is not possible to tell the dragon and the princess apart. Hint: It is possible to have two dragons and princesses in play at the same time, but it easily gets confusing.</p>
